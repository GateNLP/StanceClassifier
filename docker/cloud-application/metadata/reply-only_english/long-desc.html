<p class="clearfix">An application that classifies a reply to a tweet or other post from some threaded discussion system (forum posts, YouTube comments, etc.) based on its stance to the original without actually needing access to the post to which it is replying. Possible stances are; support, deny, query, and comment.</p>

<p class="clearfix">The input to this application can be plain text, which is assumed to be the text of a single reply post, or it can be a sequence or array of replies in JSON format. Each JSON object must contain the fields <code>text</code> and <code>id_str</code> which hold the text of the comment and a unique ID respectively. A third field <code>in_reply_to_status_id_str</code> is used to signify which other comment this one is in reply to. A simple example of one reply that is classified as supportive would be as follows:</p>

<pre>{"text":"I agree with the original post", "id_str":"2", "in_reply_to_status_id_str":"1"}</pre>

<p>Our multilingual model is based on cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base, fine-tuned using the RumourEval 2019 Twitter training set.</p>
